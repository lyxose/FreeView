Methods

Experimental Environment

The experiment was conducted in an independent room. The monitor was positioned approximately 60 cm in front of the subject, with partitions or walls on the left and right sides. The subject's head was stabilized using a chin rest, and the height of the chair and desk was adjusted to ensure comfort. Experimental stimuli were presented in full screen on a 24-inch monitor (resolution 1080 × 1920). Eye movement data were recorded using a Tobii Pro Fusion portable eye tracker at a sampling rate of 250 Hz. The device was magnetically attached to the bottom of the screen and communicated with the MATLAB experimental program via the Titta toolbox 【】. All subjects completed a 5-point calibration 【】 prior to the experiment; the experimenter checked the calibration results before the experimental task commenced.
Stimuli and Procedure
EXP1a
The experimental design was adapted from Najemnik & Geisler (2005, Nature). Before the formal experiment, subjects were required to complete 72 pre-experiment trials. Throughout the pre-experiment, subjects were instructed to fixate on the center of the screen. In each trial, after the initial fixation point disappeared, two circular textures with a radius of 7.5° were presented sequentially in the center of the screen. They were presented for 0.25 seconds each, separated by a 0.5-second gray blank screen. The texture consisted of a 1/f noise background generated randomly for each trial. Within the central 1° of one of the two textures, a circular Gabor patch (radius 0.33°, spatial frequency 6 cycles/°, clockwise tilt 45°) was embedded. Participants judged which of the two sequentially presented textures contained the target by pressing the ',<' or '.>' key. The contrast of the grating was adjusted trial-by-trial using the Quest procedure to control the subject's accuracy at approximately 70%.
In the formal experiment, participants completed a visual search task in which the target was….(describe the rationale of why you adjust the contrast before illustrating how you do it) Typically, the threshold contrast obtained from the pre-experiment is multiplied by 2 to serve as the target contrast in the formal experiment. However, some subjects exhibited high sensitivity during the pre-experiment but performed poorly in the search task, making it difficult to locate the target at the determined contrast. If a subject abandoned the search in the first three trials or if the average number of fixations exceeded 50, the experimenter manually increased the contrast until the subject could successfully complete the task. Consequently, the aforementioned pre-experiment procedure was not adopted in the subsequent Experiment 2 and Experiment 3.
In each task of the formal experiment, the target grating appeared randomly at one of 24 potential locations, defined by 8 directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonals) and 3 eccentricities (2°, 4°, and 6° visual angle). The noise background was 1/f noise generated randomly for each trial. Before the stimulus presentation, subjects were required to fixate on a black dot in the center of a gray blank screen to initiate the trial. Upon presentation of the stimulus texture, subjects were free to saccade to search any location. Once the target was detected, they were required to immediately press the spacebar and then press the "M" key while ensuring their gaze remained fixed on the target. If the eye-tracking coordinates at that moment were closer to the target location than to the other 23 possible locations, the response was judged as correct, and the fixation location was briefly displayed as a blue dot (otherwise yellow) for the subject to verify. If the displayed dot deviated significantly from the subject's subjective fixation position, the operator would restart system after recalibrated, or terminat the experiment. This design prevented systematic biases caused by insufficient eye-tracker calibration. Before the formal experiment began, each subject completed 10 practice trials with random target locations. During practice, target contrast decreased from 0.6 to 0.2 (all above individual thresholds) to familiarize subjects with the operation and task difficulty. Simultaneously, the experimenter checked whether the eye-movement feedback overlapped substantially with the target to ensure calibration accuracy. Only when all 10 practice trials were completed correctly could the subject begin the formal experiment. The formal experiment consisted of 480 trials divided into 5 blocks. As Experiment 1 had no time limit, reaction times varied a lot among subjects, with an average completion time of one hour. Five subjects failed to complete the full 480 trials due to slow search speeds, in which one subject was excluded due to a completion rate of less than 50% (see "Participants" section).
EXP1b

Experiment 1b was conducted in the same environment as Experiment 1a, using the same monitor and eye-tracking equipment. However, the target distribution orientation from Experiment 1a was rotated by 22.5° around the screen center to create the new task space for Experiment 1b. Consequently, targets appeared on the 8 bisectors between the 8 directions of Experiment 1a (22.5°, 67.5°, 112.5°, etc.), while the eccentricity distribution remained unchanged at 2°, 4°, and 6°.
Because the central threshold test in Experiment 1a was found to control the difficulty of the formal search task inadequately, the initial two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task was eliminated in Experiment 1b. Instead, the first 72 visual search trials served directly as the threshold testing phase. Except for the contrast being controlled by the Quest procedure, other settings were identical to the formal experiment. To control search difficulty, ensure sufficient valid data, and prevent excessive experiment duration, the total reaction time (time until "M" press) was used as the criterion during threshold testing. If the reaction time exceeded 2.7 s, the trial was marked as an incorrect response during the Quest update, leading to an increase in contrast and a decrease in task difficulty. This ultimately controlled the median trial duration at approximately 2.7 s (subjects were unaware of the 2.7 s criterion; blue "correct" feedback dots were displayed if the final fixation fell within 1° of the target). To prevent subjects from spending excessive time searching in a few difficult trials, the total time limit for each trial was set to 10 seconds. If the time limit was exceeded, the trial ended immediately, and the next trial began. If the subject failed to find the target within the allotted time, the task ended automatically. Since the threshold phase was identical to the formal experimental task, the 10 practice search trials were moved to before the start of the threshold phase. Other settings in Experiment 1b were the same as in Experiment 1a.
Since the threshold phase procedure was identical to the formal experiment and the task space already utilized the formal distribution, Experiment 1b comprised a total of 72 + 480 = 552 trials. To match the total experiment length in the analysis, this study extracted only the data from the first 480 trials for analysis (including the 72 trials from the dynamic contrast threshold phase).
EXP2


To dissociate effects, Experiment 2 no longer used fixed target locations. Instead, targets appeared randomly within an annular region spanning 2° to 7° eccentricity (uniform target probability per unit area).

Participants

Experiment 1a recruited 28 subjects (2 were excluded due to inability to calibrate correctly or failure to complete >50% of trials; remaining subjects: 13 males, 13 females). Experiment 1b recruited 28 subjects (2 were excluded due to insufficient eye-tracking accuracy during the experiment; remaining subjects: 14 males, 12 females). Experiment 2 recruited 29 subjects (the first 3 were excluded as the experimental program was in a debugging phase different from the final version; another was excluded due to keyboard failure terminating the experiment; remaining subjects: 13 males, 12 females).
All subjects were graduate students at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, aged between 22 and 26 years. They received a remuneration of 50 RMB per hour upon conscientious completion of the experiment. All subjects signed informed consent forms. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of （）, Ethics Number: （）.
Data Analysis

Data Preprocessing

Eye-tracking fixation coordinates were extracted using I2MC 【】, with a maximum clustering distance of 15 pixels and a minimum fixation duration of 60 ms. Subsequent analyses were based on fixation data. Data cleaning included: 1) Excluding fixations where the starting fixation was within 1° of the center; 2) Excluding the final consecutive fixations located within 1° of the target; 3) Excluding fixations falling outside the background texture radius; 4) Excluding the final few fixations that were directed toward the target (where distance to the target decreased continuously).
Visualization of Overall Fixation Distribution

The screen space (1080 × 1920 pixels) was divided uniformly into a grid of 43 × 77 bins with side lengths of approximately 25 pixels. The number of fixations within each bin was counted and normalized by the total number of fixations to obtain a spatial distribution density matrix. For visualization, density magnitude was mapped to a color gradient to intuitively reflect fixation density at different spatial locations. Experimental observations indicated that fixations within the first 1 second were consistently concentrated directly above the center (see Supplementary Material Figure （）), and most subjects reported a habit of starting the search from the top. Additionally, the amount of valid data in the search task decreased over time, with some subjects having almost no trials lasting longer than 4 seconds. Therefore, this study focused primarily on data within the 1–4 second time window.
Spatial Partition Statistics

Using the screen center as the origin, the task space was divided equidistantly into 16 sectors of 22.5° width based on potential target angles. The 8 sectors corresponding to the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions were defined as "Axis," while the remaining 8 were defined as "Gap." The "Axis" was further categorized into "Cardinal Axis" (horizontal or vertical directions) and "Oblique Axis" (diagonal directions). Calculating the proportion of total fixations falling within the 8 Axis sectors yielded the "Target Effect." Calculating the proportion of fixations within the 4 Cardinal Axis sectors relative to the total fixations in the Axis classification yielded the "Cardinal Effect." To compare the distinctions of Cardinal Axis and Oblique Axis relative to the Gap regions, the proportions of fixations in the Cardinal Axis and Oblique Axis relative to the total fixations were also calculated and compared with half of the fixation proportion in the Gap region.
To highlight local patterns, the fixation counts for the 16 sectors per subject could be detrended: the mean fixation frequency of the two sectors adjacent to a target sector served as the baseline for that sector; the difference between the sector count and the baseline yielded the detrended count. Detrended counts for all subjects were converted to z-scores and averaged to balance individual contributions to the effect. Results are shown in Supplementary Material Figure （）.
Angular Scanning Analysis

Using the screen center as the origin, an arbitrary direction was selected, and fixations within a ±5.625° sector (total width 11.25°) were counted. This window traversed all angles in 0.01° steps, arranging the data into a "Subject × 36000 Center Angles" count matrix. To eliminate differences in total fixation counts between subjects, the matrix was converted row-wise into count proportions or z-scores, termed the "Angular Scanning Matrix." The main text visualizes and statistically analyzes the proportion data, while the Supplementary Material provides z-score results.
Within-Trial Time Course Analysis

To examine the dynamic changes of the Target Effect and Cardinal Effect within trials, the fixation proportion in each region was calculated at each time point. This study used a 10 ms step size to statistically count fixations in each sector frame-by-frame and calculated the fixation proportion (or z-score) within the Axis region and Cardinal Axis region, thereby obtaining continuous time-course curves.
Trial Sequence Analysis

Using a sliding Gaussian window with σ=40, the fixation proportion for each of the 16 sectors was calculated trial-by-trial. These proportions were grouped and summed to obtain the proportion of fixations in the Axis region relative to total fixations (i.e., Target Effect) and the proportion of fixations in the Cardinal Axis region relative to the Axis region (i.e., Cardinal Effect). This generated spatial preference curves changing with the trial sequence, used to analyze learning effects and the long-term stability of preference patterns. Due to prior data screening, not every trial for every subject contained valid fixations, thus statistics were normalized by the number of valid trials within the window. In Experiment 1a, four subjects failed to complete the full 480 trials due to slow search speeds (but completed at least 73%); therefore, the final consecutive invalid trials were recorded as null values during analysis to prevent missing sections from affecting group results.
Cluster-Based Permutation Test

To test for significant differences between time-series curves and the baseline at each time point (or trial) while avoiding multiple comparison problems, this study primarily employed a cluster-based permutation test. Specifically, paired t-values were first calculated between subjects at each time point, and a threshold was set to identify continuous significant intervals (clusters). Subsequently, by randomly flipping the signs of subject data and permuting multiple times, a distribution of the maximum cluster statistic under each permutation was obtained. The p-value was derived by comparing the actually observed significant clusters with the permutation distribution, thereby controlling the Type I error rate caused by multiple comparisons. Finally, significant clusters are marked with horizontal bars at the bottom of the figures.
Mann-Kendall Trend Test

To test for monotonic trends in the time-series data, this study employed the Mann-Kendall trend test. This method evaluates the rising or falling trend of a sequence over time by analyzing the rank relationships of all data point pairs in the sequence, calculating the corresponding Z-value and two-sided p-value. To control for the influence of autocorrelation on the test results, the Hamed & Rao (1998) correction method was used, adjusting the effective sample size based on the autocorrelation coefficient of the sequence to correct the variance of the statistic. The test also calculated Sen’s slope as the effect size of the trend, reflecting the median rate of change per unit time. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered a significant trend.
V Test

To test whether angular data exhibited a significant preference in specific directions, this study used the V test for circular data. The null hypothesis assumes a uniform distribution of the sample on the circle, while the alternative hypothesis posits a central tendency in a specified direction (e.g., 0° or 180°). The V test first calculates the mean vector length and mean direction of the sample, combining this with the theoretical direction to obtain the V statistic. Subsequently, a one-tailed p-value is calculated based on normal approximation to determine if the sample distribution significantly deviates toward the specified direction. A p-value less than 0.05 determines a significant preference in that direction.
Results

EXP1a

Fixation Distribution Exhibits Spatial Preference

After grid-partitioning the screen space, the fixation frequency of each bin was intuitively presented as a heatmap (Figure （）). The center of the screen, being the starting fixation position where no targets appeared, showed relatively low fixation frequency, forming an overall annular distribution. The heatmap reveals that this ring is not isotropic; fixation frequencies differ across different directions of the task space.
 
Figure （）: Overall fixation heatmap. Screen space was gridded to calculate the spatial distribution density of fixations for all subjects within the 1–4 second time window, mapped by a color gradient. Warmer colors indicate higher fixation frequency.
To accurately identify and quantify the aforementioned spatial preference patterns, this study divided the task space into 16 equal-area sectors based on the central angle. Fixation counts for each sector were calculated and converted to proportions. The results are shown in Figure （）: the proportion of fixations in Axis sectors was frequently higher than chance level, while Gap sectors were mostly below chance level.
 	 
Figure （）: Spatial partition fixation proportion statistics for Experiment 1a. The left panel shows the division of the task space into 16 equal-area sectors, with scatter points representing all fixations included in the analysis. The right panel displays bar charts with individual scatter points representing the proportion of fixations within each sector relative to total fixations. The baseline of the bars is 1/16, representing the expected proportion under a uniform distribution. Black error bars indicate standard error. n.s., not significant; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Statistical tests were corrected using fdr_bh multiple comparison correction.
Considering the correlation of fixation frequencies between spatially continuous sectors, the 16 bars exhibit an overall fluctuating trend, which may be related to "top-down" or "left-to-right" search habits. Therefore, this study further detrended the fixation counts for each sector and converted them to z-scores, which more intuitively displays the Axis region preference (Supplementary Material Figure （）). The main text primarily uses proportional data to describe effects for intuitiveness, while z-score data are statistically analyzed in the Supplementary Material, yielding consistent conclusions.
To quantify the Axis region fixation preference, the total proportion of the 8 Axis sectors was calculated and found to be significantly higher than the 50% baseline (8 sectors occupying half the task space). Since the Axis region coincided with the task space of Experiment 1a, while no targets appeared in the Gap region, this preference is termed the "Target Effect" (t-test: P < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.88, see Figure （）). Further dividing the Axis into "Cardinal Axis" and "Oblique Axis" halves revealed that the fixation proportion in the Cardinal Axis region was significantly higher than 50%, termed the "Cardinal Effect" (t-test: P < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.72, see Figure （）). Notably, although the Axis partition included the preferred Cardinal Axis, the Target Effect was not solely driven by the Cardinal Effect, as the proportions of both Oblique Axis and Cardinal Axis in total fixations were significantly higher than half of the Gap sectors (t-test: P < 0.001, see Figure （）).

Gray crosses indicate subjects excluded for exceeding 3 standard deviations.

Statistical tests used fdr_bh multiple comparison correction. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
To depict the spatial distribution of fixations in detail, this study conducted an angular scanning analysis: using a smaller sector with halved width (11.25°), the task space was scanned rotationally in 0.01-degree steps. Calculating the fixation proportion within the sector at each angle yielded the angular scanning curve (see Figure （）). The curve shows distinct fluctuation patterns, always peaking around Axis directions (red and purple dashed lines), with peak amplitudes far exceeding the SE error band width. All 8 Axis directions exhibited peaks, supporting the stable existence of Axis spatial preference as a local effect in all Axis directions.
Corresponding to the two effects found in Figure （）, folding the 360° scanning curve by segments of 45° and 90° and summing them yielded the results in Figure （） and Figure （）. After folding by 45°, all Axis directions (0°, 45°, 90°, etc.) aligned to 0°, and the combined curve peaked at 0° while dropping to a trough at 22.5° (Gap direction). Even with the window size halved compared to the partition statistics, the difference remained significant (t-test: p < 0.01; V test on 0°: p < 0.001, see Supplementary Material Figure （）). The curve appeared very smooth, and the closer the window center angle was to 0°, the higher the fixation proportion; aside from the Target Effect, fine-grained angular scanning revealed no other fluctuation trends. After folding by 90°, aligning Cardinal Axis to 0° and Oblique Axis to 45°, the curve showed distinct local peaks at both locations, with the peak at 0° significantly higher than at 45° (t-test: p = 0.000). In summary, the angular scanning folding results confirmed the existence of the Target Effect and Cardinal Effect at higher angular resolution and preliminarily ruled out the possibility of other complex patterns.

Dynamic Properties of Fixation Spatial Preference

Both Effects are Stable Within Trials

The previous results were based on combined statistics from the 1–4 second time window. To examine the dynamic changes of the Target Effect and Cardinal Effect, it is necessary to statistically track the real-time proportions of Axis and Cardinal Axis regions time-point by time-point (Figure （） and Figure （）). Both effects remained stable after 1 second, with no obvious rising or falling trends. Cluster-based permutation tests revealed long significant effect clusters, indicating that spatial preference patterns persisted throughout the search process.

Solid lines represent means, shading represents standard error. Gray dashed lines mark the 50% chance level, and vertical dashed lines indicate the start of the combined statistical time window (1000 ms). Horizontal bars below indicate significant clusters from the cluster-based permutation test (P < 0.05).

Both Effects are Stable Across the Trial Sequence

The most intuitive hypothesis is that the Target Effect may be related to Location Probability Learning (LPL). To test for learning effects, this study used a Gaussian sliding window (σ=40) to analyze the Target Effect and Cardinal Effect across the trial sequence (Figure （）). The Target Effect showed a weak upward trend across the sequence (Mann-Kendall test: P = 0.042). However, since it was significantly higher than chance level since the initial trials, and the cluster-based permutation test showed significant effect clusters from beginning to end, it is unclear whether the Target Effect originated from subjects' location probability learning. The mean of the Cardinal Effect was also consistently higher than the 50% chance level, with no obvious rising or falling trend. Significant clusters were found in the first and last nearly 2/3 of trials, indicating that the Cardinal preference likely persisted stably throughout the experiment, independent of task progression.
 
Figure （）: Trial sequence analysis results for Experiment 1a. a, Target Effect curve across trial sequence. b, Cardinal Effect curve across trial sequence. Solid lines represent means, shading represents standard error. Gray dashed lines represent the 50% chance level. Red horizontal bars below indicate significant clusters from the cluster-based permutation test (P < 0.05).
In Experiment 1a, the task space coincided with the Cardinal Axis; thus, the observation that the Target Effect was higher than chance level in the initial trials in the figure above might actually be a manifestation of the Cardinal Effect, so the possibility that the Target Effect stems from subjects' probability learning of the target spatial distribution cannot be ruled out. Therefore, to further verify the influence of location probability learning on fixation distribution, Experiment 1b rotated the task space by 22.5°, placing targets in the center of the Gap regions so that they no longer coincided with the Cardinal Axis, thereby separating the two effects.
EXP1b

Target Space Preference Rotates with Task Space, but Cardinal Preference Persists

Fixation data in Experiment 1b showed an annular distribution similar to Experiment 1a, but obvious hotspots were no longer present in the top, bottom, left, and right directions (Figure （）). Statistical analysis of spatial partitions using the same method as Experiment 1a confirmed that the combined Axis sector statistics were contrary to Experiment 1a: the fixation proportion was significantly lower than the 50% baseline (t-test: P < 0.001, Cohen's d = -1.06, Figure （）). However, in the Axis region, the fixation proportion in the Cardinal Axis region remained significantly higher than the 50% baseline (t-test: P < 0.05, Cohen's d' = 0.43, Figure （）). Furthermore, the fixation proportions for both Cardinal Axis and Oblique Axis were significantly lower than half of the Gap sectors (t-test: P < 0.001, see Figure （）).

Statistical tests used fdr_bh multiple comparison correction.
Finer-grained angular scanning curves are shown in Figure （）. The fluctuation pattern remains distinct but with a phase difference compared to Experiment 1a: curve always shows troughs near Axis directions (red and purple dashed lines), while peaks appear around Gap directions (22.5°, 67.5°, etc.). Curves folded and aligned by 45° also show a trend opposite to Experiment 1a: after 45° folding, the 0° alignment for all Axis directions is a trough, while 22.5° (Gap direction) is a peak (t-test: p < 0.01; V test on 180°: p < 0.001, see Supplementary Material Figure （）). However, results folded by 90° reflect the Cardinal preference consistent with Experiment 1a: with Cardinal Axis aligned to 0° and Oblique Axis aligned to 45°, although both are in troughs, the trough value at 0° remains slightly higher than at 45° (t-test: p = 0.062, marginally significant).

Means are plotted as solid black lines, mean ± SE ranges are filled with gray shading, boxes indicate t-test results between two angles, dashed lines indicate chance level, and red/blue solid lines indicate significant clusters from the cluster-based permutation test (P < 0.05).
These results indicate that the Target location preference in Experiment 1b rotated with the rotation of the task space, supporting the hypothesis that the Target Effect originates from subjects' probability learning of the target spatial distribution. However, the Cardinal Axis preference relative to the Oblique Axis persisted after the task space rotation, reaffirms that the Cardinal Effect may reflect a stable endogenous spatial preference pattern independent of the probability distribution of the current task.
Rotation of Task Space Achieves Temporal Separation of Two Effects

Both Effects Remain Stable Within Trials

Statistical analysis of the Axis region fixation proportion in Experiment 1b, point-by-point, reveals that the Target Effect remained stable after the initial habit of upward saccades subsided (Figure （）). Cluster-based permutation tests identified significant effect clusters below chance level lasting approximately 3000 ms; that is, the task space rotated to the center of the Gap region led to a stable Gap region preference. The time course for the Cardinal Effect is shown in Figure （）. Because the overall Axis fixation proportion was low, the Cardinal Axis region proportion fluctuated considerably; however, except for some time points where the curve was near the 50% chance level, it was higher than chance level for most time points. A significant effect cluster was found around 2000 ms via cluster-based permutation test, indicating that the Cardinal Effect persisted.

Horizontal bars below indicate significant clusters from the cluster-based permutation test (P < 0.05).

Cardinal Effect Persists Across Trial Sequence, While Target Effect Shows Clear Learning

Using the same method as in Experiment 1a, the changes in Target Effect and Cardinal Effect across the trial sequence in Experiment 1b were statistically analyzed (Figure （）) to identify learning effects. It can be observed that the fixation proportion in the Axis region was close to chance level in the initial trials, then gradually decreased. The cluster-based permutation test identified significant effect clusters from approximately the 50th trial to the end. This provides strong evidence that the Target Effect indeed originates from subjects' location probability learning. Furthermore, subjects learned very quickly, generating significant spatial preferences after only about 50 trials. Within the Axis region, the proportion of fixations falling in the Cardinal region was significantly higher than the 50% chance level from the first trial (cluster-based permutation test), and although the subsequent curve fluctuated, the mean consistently remained above the 50% baseline. These results further support the idea that the Cardinal Effect reflects a certain endogenous spatial preference pattern, unrelated to the task space and unaffected by task experience.

Solid lines represent means, shading represents standard error. Gray dashed lines mark the 50% chance level, used as the baseline for significance tests. Red horizontal bars below indicate significant clusters from the cluster-based permutation test (P < 0.05).
The results of Experiment 1b validated the hypothesis that spatial probability learning of the target location drives the Target Effect, while simultaneously confirming the existence of the Cardinal Effect as a stable, endogenous spatial preference pattern. If this interpretation holds true, an isotropic space—where target probability is uniform—should eliminate the Target Effect preference for the 8 specific directions, allowing for the observation of a "clean" Cardinal Effect in isolation. Therefore, we conducted Experiment 2 to further investigate the properties of the Cardinal Effect.
EXP2

Only Cardinal Effect Persists in Isotropic Task Space

In Experiment 2, targets appeared with completely uniform location probability within an annular space of 2–7 degrees visual angle; thus, neither location probability learning nor priming effects would induce any directional spatial preference. Using the same spatial partitioning method as before, the fixation proportion in the Cardinal Axis region in Experiment 2 was significantly higher than the 50% chance level (t-test: P < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.05, see Figure （）), supporting the endogenous property of the Cardinal Effect. Further calculating the proportions of Cardinal Axis and Oblique Axis fixations relative to the total and comparing them with half of the Gap region, the fixation proportion in the Cardinal Axis region was significantly higher (t-test: P < 0.001), while the Oblique Axis region proportion was significantly lower (t-test: P < 0.01, see Figure （）). This result suggests that the Cardinal Effect is actually the result of the opposing forces of a preference for Cardinal axes and a neglect of Oblique axes. Due to the preference for the Cardinal Axis, the overall fixation proportion in the Axis region was also significantly higher than the 50% baseline (t-test: P < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.58, see Figure （）), indicating that the intensity of the Cardinal preference effect is actually stronger than the neglect of the Oblique, which also indirectly explains why the Target Effect in the trial sequence analysis of Experiment 1a was significantly higher than chance level in the early trials.

Statistical tests used fdr_bh multiple comparison correction.
Step-wise angular scanning results further supported the above inference. As shown in Figure （）, three of the four Cardinal Axis directions (0°, 90°, 270°) coincided with local peaks, while three of the Oblique Axis directions (45°, 135°, 315°) were in local trough positions. Results folded by 90° also showed the Cardinal preference: with Cardinal Axis aligned to 0° and Oblique Axis aligned to 45°, the peak appeared only at 0°, while 45° was in a flat trough position, with a significant difference between the two (t-test: p < 0.001, see Figure （）). These results not only reconfirmed the endogenous property of the Cardinal Effect but also intuitively presented the process behind the Cardinal Effect where Cardinal and Oblique orientations exert opposing forces on fixation preference. The 45° folded results aligned with the overall Axis region proportion results: due to the increase in fixation frequency near the Cardinal Axis being stronger than the fixation loss in the Oblique Axis region, a small peak appeared near 0° aligned with the Axis (still significantly higher than at 22.5°, t-test: P < 0.05, see Figure （）), whereas the curve was flat at other angles, and the amplitude of this peak was much lower than in Experiments 1a and 1b.

Cardinal Effect is Stable Across Time and Trial Sequence

Cardinal Effect is Stable Within Trials

This study also analyzed the within-trial time course of the Cardinal Effect in Experiment 2 (see Figure （）). Results showed that the Cardinal Effect remained stable after 1 second, and cluster-based permutation tests identified significant effect clusters in most time segments from approximately 1500 ms onwards, again supporting that the Cardinal Effect persists throughout the search process rather than being limited to specific time windows. However, since the task space in Experiment 2 was uniform and there was no Target Effect caused by location probability learning or priming effects, the overall Axis region fixation proportion remained basically near the chance level across the within-trial time course, as shown in Figure （）.

Solid lines represent means, shading represents standard error. Gray dashed lines mark the 50% chance level, used as the baseline for significance tests; vertical dashed lines indicate the start of the combined statistical time window (1000 ms). Horizontal bars below indicate significant clusters from the cluster-based permutation test (P < 0.05).

Cardinal Effect is Stable Across Trial Sequence

At the trial sequence level, the Cardinal Effect in Experiment 2 was also very stable (see Figure （）). The curve mean was consistently higher than the 50% chance level with no sustained upward trend, and the cluster-based permutation test identified significant effect clusters throughout the entire process, again indicating that the Cardinal preference persisted throughout the experiment and was unrelated to task progression. Meanwhile, the fixation proportion in the Axis region remained near the chance level for most of the trial sequence (see Figure （）), and no significant effect clusters were found.

Inter-Experiment Analysis

Target Effect Depends on Task Space Layout

Analysis of the aggregated fixation statistics across the Axis regions consistently demonstrates that the spatial preference driven by the Target Effect rotates when the task space heterogeneity rotates (Exp 1a vs. Exp 1b) and vanishes when it is eliminated (Exp 2). A significant interaction effect was observed among the Axis region fixation proportions across the three experiments (P < 0.001), and post-hoc pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences across all three conditions (P<0.01). This interaction effect confirms that the Target Effect is indeed contingent upon the target probability distribution within the task space, strongly supporting the idea of spatial probability learning.

Violin width represents probability density, the box represents the interquartile range, and the horizontal line indicates the median. Gray crosses indicate subjects excluded for exceeding 3 standard deviations. The gray dashed line represents the 50% chance level. Statistical tests for comparisons with baseline used fdr_bh multiple correction; pairwise group comparisons used Tukey-Kramer multiple correction. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
Cardinal Effect is Unaffected by Task Space

ANOVA analysis was also performed on the Cardinal Axis region fixation proportions across the three experiments, revealing no significant differences between the three experiments (P = 0.85). This result further supports the attribute of the Cardinal Effect as a stable endogenous spatial preference pattern, which is almost unaffected by the probability distribution of the task space.
