> A cognitive psychology experiment investigating how humans navigate novel visual spaces

## Overview
This repository contains experimental protocols and data analysis tools for studying human visual search behavior under 1/f noise backgrounds. Our task, adapted from Najemnik et al. (Nature, 2005) and optimized for investigating detailed spatial-temporal prior (or hotspot), was based on Tobbi pro fusion eye tracker and Titta package (Diederick C. Niehorster 2020). Please run `FreeView_main.m` and follow the instructions to start an experiment. The analysis tools are in the folder `Analysis`
